<h2>Devastating Impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities</h2>
<ol> 
<li><b>Financial Impact:</b>
<p>Cyberattacks cause major financial losses by interfering 
with services and manufacturing. Additional costs for 
organizations include fines for non-compliance with rules 
and the cost of remediation and recovery operations. 
The difficulty of continuing operations might be made worse 
by these financial repercussions, which can worsen, 
particularly in delicate industries or during significant 
breaches.

</li>
<li><b>Operational Disruption:</b>
<p> Most time, critical corporate activities can be stopped 
by cyberattacks, leading to service interruptions and 
production delays. Revenue and productivity are hampered 
by these disruptions because businesses find it difficult 
to resume regular operations. Such disruptions may have 
long-term repercussions that impact the general productivity 
and profitability of the company.

</li>
<li><b>Intellectual Property Theft:</b>
<p>Attackers frequently target confidential data, 
including patents and trade secrets. Intellectual property 
loss can hinder innovation and jeopardize the long-term 
commercial plans of a firm. Industries that depend on 
intellectual capital are particularly vulnerable 
to this theft.</p>
