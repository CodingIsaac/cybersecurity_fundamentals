<h1>Cyber Kill Chain Steps</h1>
<p>The Cyber Kill Chain is a framework that outlines the steps adversaries typically follow to execute a successful cyber attack. It was developed by Lockheed Martin, this model breaks down the attack process into seven distinct phases, each representing a critical stage in the lifecycle of a cyber intrusion.

By understanding the sequential nature of these steps, organizations can identify and disrupt an attack at any stage, preventing further progression. The Cyber Kill Chain serves as a guide for security teams to recognize adversary behavior, implement countermeasures, and fortify defenses.</p>

The seven Cyber Kill Chain steps are:
