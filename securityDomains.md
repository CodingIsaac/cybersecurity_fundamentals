<br>
<p>
CISSP, or 
Certified Information Systems Security Professional, 
is a globally recognized certification for cybersecurity 
professionals, administered by nformation System Security Certification Consortium, commonly known as (ISC)². 
It signifies expertise in managing and implementing effective security frameworks for organizations. 
Although it is a certification, and the certification is built around eight core security domains that collectively provide 
a comprehensive framework for securing systems, data, and operations. 
These domains form the foundation of the CISSP framework, ensuring professionals 
are equipped to address modern cybersecurity challenges with both technical and managerial skills.

<ol>
<li><h2>Security and Risk Management:</h2></li>
<p>Generally, Security and Risk Management involves identifying,
assessing, and mitigating risks while establishing governance, 
policies, and compliance to ensure an organization operates 
securely and efficiently.</p>
<h3> Key Concepts</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Security and Risk Management include:

- Risk assessment and management
- Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethics
- Business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery (DR)
- Security policies and governance
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>In 2018, Marriott International experienced a data breach 
exposing 500 million records. The incident stemmed from weak governance and 
failure to identify risks within its acquired systems. 
A proactive risk management strategy and BCP could have 
mitigated the impact.
</p>
<li> <h2>Asset Security:</h2>
<p>Asset security focuses on data classification, handling, and protection. This ensures 
that sensitive data are properly classified, stored, accessed, and transferred securely.
<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Asset Security include:

- Data classification and protection
- Handling and securing sensitive information
- Retention policies for data lifecycle management

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Sometime in 2019, Facebook had a breach and this breach revealed over 540 million unprotected 
user records stored on an unsecured server. Proper asset classification and encryption could have prevented 
unauthorized access.</p>

</li>
<li> 
<h2>Security Architecture and Engineering:</h2>
<p> This domain involves designing and implementing secure physical and digital systems, including encryption, firewalls, and secure architecture frameworks.</p>
<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Security Architecture and Engineering include:

- Secure system design principles (e.g., Zero Trust architecture)
- Cryptography and physical security
- Security models (e.g., Bell-LaPadula and Clark-Wilson)
<h3> Example: </h3>
<p>The 2021 Florida water treatment plant attack occurred due to inadequate security engineering. Implementing network segmentation and secure architecture could have protected critical systems from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Communication and Network Security:</h2>
<p>Communication and Network Security ensures the secure transmission of data across networks by implementing protective measures such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access and breaches.</p>

<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Communication and Network Security include:

- Secure communication channels (e.g., VPN, encryption)
- Network protocols and protection (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Prevent network-based attacks

<h3> Example:</h3>
<p>In 2013, Target suffered a massive breach after attackers exploited a third-party vendor's network credentials. Network segmentation and better communication security protocols could have restricted access to critical systems.</p>
</li>
<br>

<li> <h2>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
<p> The central gist about Identity and Access Management (IAM) is that it ensures that the right individuals have access to the right resources, right level of access, at the right times, using measures such as authentication, authorization, and role-based controls to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Identity and Access Management include:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Identity governance and provisioning
<h3>Example:</h3> 
<p>The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021 was caused by a single compromised password with no MFA in place. Implementing robust IAM policies would have prevented the unauthorized access that led to the breach. And apart from this IAM sits at the corner piece of all attacks, too much access with eventually lead to privilege escalations.</p>
</li>

<li><h2>Security Assessment and Testing:</h2>
<p> 
Security Assessment and Testing involves evaluating an organization’s security measures through methods like vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and audits. These activities identify weaknesses, ensure controls are effective, and provide insights to strengthen defenses against potential threats. Regular testing is critical for maintaining robust security postures.
</p>

<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Security Assessment and Testing include:

- Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- Auditing security systems and controls
- Continuous monitoring and risk assessments
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Equifax's 2017 breach exposing 147 million records occurred due to an unpatched vulnerability in their systems. Regular security assessments and timely patch management could have averted this disaster.</p>
</li>

<li> <h2>Security Operations:</h2>
<p> 
Security Operations focuses on the continuous monitoring, detection, and response to cybersecurity threats. It involves incident management, threat intelligence, and leveraging tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to protect systems, ensure uptime, and minimize the impact of attacks. This proactive approach helps organizations stay resilient against ever-evolving threats.
</p>
<h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Security Operations include:


- Incident response and management
- Security monitoring through tools like SIEM
- Threat intelligence and proactive threat hunting
<h3>Example:</h3> 
<p>A large financial institution successfully thwarted a DDoS attack by leveraging its Security Operations Center (SOC) and real-time threat monitoring tools to identify and neutralize the threat before it caused damage.</p>

</li>
<li><h2>Software Development Security</h2>
<p>Software Development Security ensures that security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It includes secure coding practices, vulnerability testing, and embedding security controls into DevOps (DevSecOps) pipelines to prevent exploitation of applications, protect sensitive data, and reduce risks from the ground up. </p>
<h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Software Development Security include:

- Secure coding practices
- Testing for vulnerabilities during development
- Integration of security into DevOps pipelines (DevSecOps)
<h3>Example:</h3> 
<p>In 2021, a popular mobile app suffered a data breach due to poor coding practices that left user data exposed. Incorporating secure software development practices and regular code reviews could have prevented the breach, and this happens frequently for a lot of mobile apps.</p>
