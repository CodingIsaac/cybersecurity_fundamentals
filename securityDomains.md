<p>Imagine it’s a typical Monday morning at your company's just like every other Tech team, your team is busy handling emails, 
preparing for the usual monday meetings. Suddenly, chaos erupts, well cyber issues always happens suddenly. 
A senior executive receives an email from what looks like your CFO, urgently requesting a wire transfer. 
Believing the email to be legitimate, the senior executive complies. 
However, 30 minutes later the truth sinks in that it was a sophisticated phishing attack, and the money is gone.<br>

The chaos continues on different levels from managing PR with customers, to damage control from the executive team, 
back and forth calls with the Bank, legal teams prepare for lawsuits, and regulatory fines are there too. 
The truth of matter is, cyber hacks unprecedented chaos, threatening the company’s very survival and every organization 
should always prepare and do all it takes to prevent it. <br>

In this article, we will answer key questions to help understand the CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) framework: 
Who is CISSP? What are the eight CISSP Security Domains? And most importantly, how do these domains create tangible value for businesses in their fight against cyber threats?

We will highlight each of the eight CISSP Security Domains and demonstrate how they act as core pillars of protection, 
ensuring your organization stays resilient no matter the threat. Using real-life examples, we will draw connections between 
these domains and the chaos that can happen when they are neglected. You will also discover actionable checks to implement 
within each domain, turning these theoretical concepts into practical safeguards.

Kindly take note that these domains are more than just boxes to check—they form a comprehensive shield that 
fortifies your organization against cybercriminals’ most sophisticated tactics.

<h2> What is CISSP? </h2>   
<img src="/Images/CISSP.jpeg"> 
<br>
<p>
To help us understand fundamental concepts regarding CISSP, CISSP, or 
Certified Information Systems Security Professional, 
is a globally recognized certification for cybersecurity 
professionals, administered by (ISC)². 
It signifies expertise in managing and implementing effective security programs. 
The certification is built around eight core security domains that collectively provide 
a comprehensive framework for securing systems, data, and operations. 
These domains form the foundation of the CISSP framework, ensuring professionals 
are equipped to address modern cybersecurity challenges with both technical and managerial skills.

<li><h2>Security and Risk Management:</li></h2>
<p>Generally, Security and Risk Management involves identifying,
assessing, and mitigating risks while establishing governance, 
policies, and compliance to ensure an organization operates 
securely and efficiently.</p>
<h3> Key Concepts</h3>
Some of the Key concepts in Security and Risk Management include:

- Risk assessment and management
- Compliance with laws, regulations, and ethics
- Business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery (DR)
- Security policies and governance
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>In 2018, Marriott International experienced a data breach 
exposing 500 million records. The incident stemmed from weak governance and 
failure to identify risks within its acquired systems. 
A proactive risk management strategy and BCP could have 
mitigated the impact.
</p>
<li> <h2>Asset Security:</h2>
<p>Asset security focuses on data classification, handling, and protection. This ensures 
that sensitive data are properly classified, stored, accessed, and transferred securely.
<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>

- Data classification and protection
- Handling and securing sensitive information
- Retention policies for data lifecycle management

<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>Facebook's 2019 data breach revealed 540 million unprotected 
user records stored on an unsecured server. 
Proper asset classification and encryption could have prevented 
unauthorized access.</p>

</li>
<li> 
<h2>Security Architecture and Engineering:</h2>
<p> This domain involves designing and implementing secure physical and digital systems, including encryption, firewalls, and secure architecture frameworks.</p>
<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>

- Secure system design principles (e.g., Zero Trust architecture)
- Cryptography and physical security
- Security models (e.g., Bell-LaPadula and Clark-Wilson)
<h3> Example: </h3>
<p>The 2021 Florida water treatment plant attack occurred due to inadequate security engineering. Implementing network segmentation and secure architecture could have protected critical systems from unauthorized access.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Communication and Network Security:</h2>
<p>Communication and Network Security ensures the secure transmission of data across networks by implementing protective measures such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to prevent unauthorized access and breaches.</p>

<h3> Key Concepts:</h3>

- Securing communication channels (e.g., VPN, encryption)
- Network protocols and protection (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS)
- Preventing network-based attacks

<h3> Example:</h3>
<p>In 2013, Target suffered a massive breach after attackers exploited a third-party vendor's network credentials. Network segmentation and better communication security protocols could have restricted access to critical systems.</p>
