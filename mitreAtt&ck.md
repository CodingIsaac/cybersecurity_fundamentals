<h1> Understanding and Building Resilient Cyber Defenses with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.</h1>
<h2> Author: Isaac Ijuo </h2>
<p>The MITRE ATT&CK framework is short for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge and it is a globally recognized knowledge base that categorizes the behaviors and method hackers use to conduct their heist. The framework was developed by MITRE, a nonprofit organization which specializes in systems engineering and cybersecurity, the framework provides a structured approach to understanding how attacks occurs and where defenses can be strengthened.

Majorly, the framework is divided into two primary components:


- Tactics: The adversaryâ€™s goals during different phases of an attack, such as reconnaissance, persistence, or lateral movement.

- Techniques: The specific methods attackers use to achieve their tactical objectives, like phishing, malware deployment, Ransomeware or credential dumping.
