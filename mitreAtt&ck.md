<h1> Understanding and Building Resilient Cyber Defenses with the MITRE ATT&CK Framework.</h1>
<h2> Author: Isaac Ijuo </h2>
<p>The MITRE ATT&CK framework is short for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge and it is a globally recognized knowledge base that categorizes the behaviors and method hackers use to conduct their heist. The framework was developed by MITRE, a nonprofit organization which specializes in systems engineering and cybersecurity, the framework provides a structured approach to understanding how attacks occurs and where defenses can be strengthened.

Majorly, the framework is divided into two primary components:


- Tactics: The adversaryâ€™s goals during different phases of an attack, such as reconnaissance, persistence, or lateral movement.

- Techniques: The specific methods attackers use to achieve their tactical objectives, like phishing, malware deployment, Ransomeware or credential dumping.

<h2>Key Tactics in the Framework</h2>
<p>Each tactic represents a stage in the attack lifecycle, offering insights into how adversaries operate. Some of the critical tactics include:

Reconnaissance: Gathering information about a target, such as IP addresses and employee details.
Persistence: Maintaining access through backdoors or rootkits.
Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher privileges to access critical resources.
Lateral Movement: Expanding access across a network using compromised credentials.
Impact: The ultimate damage caused, including data theft, system sabotage, or financial loss.
