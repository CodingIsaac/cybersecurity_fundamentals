<h2>What is XML External Entity?</h2>
<p>To understand XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, it is best to first review what XML is.</p>
<p><strong>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</strong> is a markup language designed for structuring and storing data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable

Often time, it uses tags to define the structure and content of the data, allowing for easy representation and exchange between systems. XML’s flexibility makes it powerful, but this same flexibility can also introduce vulnerabilities, which hackers could exploit.

<h2>Understanding XXE Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>An <strong>XXE vulnerability</strong> occurs when an application processes malicious XML input, allowing an attacker to exploit external entities defined in the XML. External entities can be used to access sensitive files, execute server-side request forgery (SSRF), or perform other malicious actions. This vulnerability is commonly found in applications that accept XML input without proper validation.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Exploitation </h2>

An attacker could exploit XXE vulnerabilities via various input points, such as:

- Form fields that accept XML input

- Uploaded XML files

- APIs using XML-based payloads

- Configuration files processed as XML

By injecting malicious XML that references external entities, attackers can compromise the system and potentially access sensitive information, perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or execute remote code.

<section>
<h2>How XML External Entity Works</h2>
<p>The success of an XXE attack depends on how the server’s XML parser handles external entities. Let’s consider an example of vulnerable PHP code:</p>
<pre><code>

<?php
$xml = file_get_contents('php://input');
$dom = new DOMDocument();
$dom->loadXML($xml);
echo $dom->saveXML();
?>

</code></pre>
<p>An attacker could inject the following payload:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"&gt; ]&gt;
&lt;foo&gt;&xxe;&lt;/foo&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Impact of XML External Entity Vulnerabilities</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Disclosure</strong>: Access to sensitive files, such as configuration files or credentials.</li>
<li><strong>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</strong>: Abusing the server to make requests to internal or external systems.</li>
<li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS)</strong>: Overloading server resources with malicious XML payloads.</li>
<li><strong>Remote Code Execution (RCE)</strong>:In extreme cases, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.</li>
</ul>
