<h2>What is XML External Entity?</h2>
<p>To understand XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, it is best to first review what XML is.</p>
<p><strong>XML (Extensible Markup Language)</strong> is a markup language designed for structuring and storing data in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable

Often time, it uses tags to define the structure and content of the data, allowing for easy representation and exchange between systems. XMLâ€™s flexibility makes it powerful, but this same flexibility can also introduce vulnerabilities, which hackers could exploit.

<h2>Understanding XXE Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>An <strong>XXE vulnerability</strong> occurs when an application processes malicious XML input, allowing an attacker to exploit external entities defined in the XML. External entities can be used to access sensitive files, execute server-side request forgery (SSRF), or perform other malicious actions. This vulnerability is commonly found in applications that accept XML input without proper validation.</p>
